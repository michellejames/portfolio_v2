<h1>Welcome to my Portfolio!</h1>

<div>
	<p>Hallo! Mein Name ist <span>Shelly</span>. Ich komme aus N&uuml;rnberg, <span>Deuschland</span>.</p>
	 
	<p>Now I’m living it up in the bustling city of <span>Atlanta</span>, GA home to some of the greatest music and culinary delights the USA has to offer!</p>
	 
	<p>I received a Marketing Communications Degree from Staatliche FOS N&uuml;rnberg in Germany and spent several years working for one of Germany’s largest <span>Public Relations</span> agencies where I got experience in the fashion, food and celebrity industries. I was always attracted to smart, innovative work that wasn’t just flashy but resonated with a consumer and empowered them.</p>
	 
	<p>In an ever-evolving, Digital Age, nothing was as exciting to me as coding and being the change I wanted to see. The <span>Creative Circus</span> has honed my skillset and I’m ready to make my impact for good on the world!</p>
